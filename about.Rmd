## About Me
My name is **Shreya Sree Morishetty**. I go to Dublin Coffman High School, and I will be a senior next year. My interests include playing the flute, designing projects, and creative writing. This is my first experience with Data Science. 

## About the Project
*Growth in undergrad engineering program enrollment from 2003-2013*: This project outlines the changes in the number of student enrollments from 2003 to 2013 for engineering projects. The graphs compares the differences based on race or gender.

### Goals
* Understand the change in interest for engineering for all students
* Observe how the differences between races and genders have changed
  + The numbers are large so a variation might be too small to notice
